# Streamlit Snowflake Login Page

This Python script, `login_page.py`, is a simple login page built using Streamlit, a popular Python library for building web applications, and Snowflake, a cloud-based data platform. The login page allows users to authenticate themselves using their credentials stored in a Snowflake database.

## Features
- **User-friendly interface:** The login page provides input fields for users to enter their username and password.
- **Secure authentication:** User credentials are validated against the Snowflake database to ensure secure access.
- **Error handling:** The script handles potential errors gracefully, providing clear feedback to users in case of invalid credentials or other issues.
- **Streamlit integration:** The login page is built using Streamlit, allowing for easy deployment and customization.

## Usage
To run the login page script, ensure you have the necessary access to a Snowflake account with the appropriate user details set up in the database. Copy-paste `login_page.py` code into a Streamlit app page.
